Digital Elevation Models are produced by NASAâ€™s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission ( https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org). These are crucial for viewshed computations in the replication. Due to size constraints, the original DEMs are not included as part of our replication kit. The user will need to download and extract the data to this directory. After extraction, there is supposed to be 7 TIF files, with names from "cut_n00w090.tif" to "cut_n30w180.tif".
