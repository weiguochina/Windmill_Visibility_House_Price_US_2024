Windmill data can be accessed from the United States Wind Turbine Database (USWTDB) produced by USGS50 (https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/data/). 

To proceed, the user will need to download and extract the original shapefile ("uswtdb_v4_1.shp") to the current directory. The key data is consolidated and and saved as windmill.dta.
